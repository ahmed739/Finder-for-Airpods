# Finder for Airpods (iOS)
An app released in the beginning of January to help find your missing Airpods using their bluetooth signals. The app gave users an idea of how to find their Airpods with the use of simple tutorial screens and a simple bluetooth range guage. 

The app was pulled a few days later, and now that the heat of the media has settled the project is now open-source.
